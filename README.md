OVERVIEW:

In agricultural and food industries, the accurate classification of dry beans is essential for quality control, pricing, and processing automation. Traditionally, bean classification is performed manually, which is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to human errors. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can automatically classify dry beans based on their morphological characteristics, improving efficiency and accuracy in classification.
OBJECTIVE:

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can classify different varieties of dry beans based on their shape and geometric features. Using supervised machine learning techniques, the model will analyze key morphological attributes such as area, perimeter, aspect ratio, roundness, and compactness to distinguish between different bean types.
